            At this point I'd probably be encouraged and reaffirmed in the idea that this could really become something! It's likely that I'll begin to host more event nights and the like. As I take it more seriously.

            I'll start up the Gay Baby Jail Minecraft server again! It'll have a chat bridge to Discord so that messages in the #minecraft channel go to the Minecraft server and vise-versa. It will also have an automatically shared economy! Cookies in Minecraft convert to Cookies in Discord, so that will be a huge way to spend and earn Cookies!

            I will commission more images of Cookie Dough that can act both as just straight up generally good ABDL images, on top of doubling as original assets for the Discord. Cookie Dough emotes are also on the wishlist.

Maybe physical prints of Cookie Dough (high quality posters and the like) given out to donators (and perhaps available in a merch store for non-donators). Art would be commissioned to be specifically tailored to clothes or posters (patterns for clothes, full color backgrounds, etc for posters)

            I know this looks like I'm just saying it, but if I had the time and resources I will throw myself into likely one of two things on top of the goals of this donation page. To speak in the most general way that I can as to not spoil my ideas: An ABDL website and an ABDL game. I don't want to go into further detail on either until I have something to show for it, but i'm passionate about both ideas 🤐

<!--
        <h2 class="text-center">Why Would A Discord Server Need a Donation Page?</h2>
        <p class="text-center"> 
            In our case, there's actually quite a few reasons! For example:
            <li>I could reinvest what's donated back into the server to commission more art assets like the one we have for Cookie Dough's profile picture. More art assets could mean that we'd be able to rebrand the server to use only original characters, or get custom made Cookie Dough emoji for the server to cover some bases we don't have (such as a starry-eyed hype or index-on-cheek thinking). I'd also be able to invest in things like server resources to get our Minecraft server back up again!</li>
            <li>I would be able to invest more time into coding Cookie Dough so that updates come out faster, and you get features sooner. I would also be able to invest more time into making the Discord be the best it can be in general. I've actually ran into some trouble at work before because I've been distracted taking care of things in the Discord, haha!</li>
            <li>I would be able to pursue much loftier ambitions for the ABDL community than what the Discord server is. I do not want to make any promises about anything right now. But, to give you an idea it would be either an ABDL website or an ABDL game. Maybe both. (I'd like to keep the ideas for both to myself to protect them), if in a semi-distant future you want to see something like that, it's something I'd love to do!</li>
        </p>
-->
            
        <h2 class="text-center">Well, What Would I Get Out of It?</h2>
        <p>Well, you'd get a better quality Discord as I would have more time and motivation to dedicate to the server, and besides that, you will get whatever bonuses are laid out in the donation tiers, as well as a big old hug! If you think there's something we could deliver on in the tiers that you'd like to see, please let me know! - Sigh
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-center">I'm worried about the fact that you can buy cookies, isn't that kind of a microtransaction?</h2>
        <p> While yes, this is is maybe possibly a microtransaction (I think?)... It's not really the goal to monetize cookies. Cookie balance will not change for those who don't pay, and I will continue to try my hardest to ensure that everyone gets the most value they can out of the cookie system, both to donators and non-donators. Thus, there is only so much I am able to give away, but I want to send every kind of thank you to those who believe in what I'm doing. I personally promise that this will not stifle or nerf anyone else's ability to earn and spend cookies. The goal in giving them away in reward tiers is to send a thank-you to donators. I will continue to balance, but non-donator balance will be exactly the same as if I didn't accept donations in the first place. - Sigh
